## What is it?

This is my multi-month study plan for going from web developer (self-taught, no CS degree) to software engineer for a large company.

![Coding at the whiteboard - from HBO's Silicon Valley](https://d3j2pkmjtin6ou.cloudfront.net/coding-at-the-whiteboard-silicon-valley.png)

This is meant for **new software engineers** or those switching from
software/web development to software engineering (where computer science knowledge is required). If you have
many years of experience and are claiming many years of software engineering experience, expect a harder interview.

If you have many years of software/web development experience, note that large software companies like Google, Amazon,
Facebook and Microsoft view software engineering as different from software/web development, and they require computer science knowledge.

If you want to be a reliability engineer or operations engineer, study more from the optional list (networking, security).
