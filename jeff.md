Do the form over and over and over.  Have it corrected over and over.  Complete understanding of the 4 forces (Peng, Lu, Ji and An) first.  Then the 4 corners (Tsai, Lei, Zhou and Kao), some call the 8 energies.  Understanding the expression of 4 forces in the form is most important.

Learning to truly move the energy.  It starts with relaxation, feeling the movement of relaxing go down through the body.  Then understanding the Jing (connection/root/essence) & Qi relationship as they both must be present at the same time.  

If you are around and can come to the park I can help you.  Push hands are pretty much out for now, but understanding the energies will help!  You must learn a whole form and be doing it constantly.  Do you remember any of ours?

When I was your age I did Taijiquan a minimum of 3 hours every weekday and 5 hours a day on weekends.  You should compete in order to guage yourself and compare your ability to others.
